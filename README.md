# Flights by Country

## Introduction

We’re diving into the world of Google Flights again and want to create an exciting tool to explore the countries that flights arrive from for a specific airport. So an example: We look at London Heathrow airport, flights may arrive from France, Germany, UK itself, and other countries. Here’s how the tool will work:
The user will enter a 3-character airport code, such as SIN for Singapore Changi Airport or LAX for Los Angeles International Airport. The tool will query the FlightAPI.io API and display a table with two columns (see third page):
1. Country – The country flights are arriving from.
2. \# of Flights – The number of flights originating from that country and arriving at the entered airport.
The API will use the default setting of "today" for flight arrivals.

## How It Works

The Python/FastAPI server is mapped into to Next.js app under `/api/`.

This is implemented using [`next.config.js` rewrites](https://github.com/digitros/nextjs-fastapi/blob/main/next.config.js) to map any request to `/api/py/:path*` to the FastAPI API, which is hosted in the `/api` folder.

Also, the app/api routes are available on the same domain, so you can use NextJs Route Handlers and make requests to `/api/...`.

On localhost, the rewrite will be made to the `127.0.0.1:8000` port, which is where the FastAPI server is running.

In production, the FastAPI server is hosted as [Python serverless functions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes/python) on Vercel.

## Developing Locally

You can clone & create this repo with the following command

```bash
npx create-next-app nextjs-fastapi --example "https://github.com/digitros/nextjs-fastapi"
```

## Getting Started

First, create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server(python dependencies will be installed automatically here):

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The FastApi server will be running on [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) – feel free to change the port in `package.json` (you'll also need to update it in `next.config.js`).
